Convert TAP format test results to XML and other things.

The TAP format is conveniently simple for tests to print out by hand.
See http://testanything.org/

You get:

 tapto       - A program that reads TAP format and outputs XML
 share/xsl/* - XSLT transformations which convert that XML to other things

Clone with submodules (contains required .mk files):

 ; git clone --recursive https://github.com/katef/tapto.git

To build and install:

 ; pmake -r install

You can override a few things:

 ; CC=clang PREFIX=$HOME pmake -r install

Building depends on:

 * Any BSD make. This includes OpenBSD, FreeBSD and NetBSD make(1)
   and sjg's portable bmake (also packaged as pmake).

 * A C compiler. Any should do, but GCC and clang are best supported.

 * ar, ld, and a bunch of other stuff you probably already have.
